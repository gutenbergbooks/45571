ACT I
</h2>

<p>
<i>Scene</i>&#8212;<span class="sc">Jane's</span> <i>house on Gramercy
Park. A living room with doors R. and L. Entrance U. R. Curtains U.
C., showing an alcove which looks out on the Park.</i> <span
class="sc">Dill</span>, <i>in velvet knickerbockers and jacket, is
arranging service for tea</i>. <span class="sc">Jack</span>, <i>a
young man of twenty, has entered. He wears green kid gloves and a
green Alpine hat to match.</i>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> So you're getting married, Dill?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> I am, sir. Have you any objections to offer?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> None whatever, Dill. But why tea at this
hour? It's only just past lunch.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> It's the very latest thing, sir; all Americans
are doing it now. It's to keep up with the London
time, sir, and there it's tea-time already. (<i>Examines
a crumpled manuscript with his back to</i> <span class="sc">Jack</span>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>indifferently</i>). What is that, Dill?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> It's a will, sir.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>observing</i>. <span class="sc">Dill's</span> <i>progress about the room</i>).
Never admit that you have a will, Dill. Where there's
a will there's a conscience, you know. One must get
over such things.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> I'll try to, sir. (<i>Puts manuscript back in
pocket.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>with an air of importance</i>). I've some melancholy
news, Dill.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> Melancholy for whom, sir?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> For you, Dill, and for my father. I hope
you won't take it too seriously when I say you're the
living picture of my father.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> Oh, I just adore pictures, sir.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> My father does not adore you, Dill. He
took you for his brother.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill</span> (<i>with dignity</i>). Really, sir! Who do you say
that I am, sir?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>facing about</i>). I say you're the butler, Dill.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> Quite right, sir. (<i>Attentively.</i>) Are you a
gentleman?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> By no means.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> Your father?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Nor he either. (<i>Enter</i> <span class="sc">Jane</span>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> My brother was a gentleman. (<i>Exit haughtily
with tray.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane</span> <i>is forty, a young woman of forty. If failure is
the worst deformity, she must be open to that accusation,
for she has compromised with life. But</i> <span class="sc">Jane</span> <i>will
always be something a little better than a woman</i>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> What is it all about, Jack? Yourself?
Kathryn? Or merely me?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> None of us, Jane. Dill said that he was
getting married.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Oh, Dill's always getting married. He
never does, though.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> And then Dill was telling me about a brother
of his, and I was telling him about a brother of my
father's. I have never told you, Jane, but father
really came here looking for a brother. Sort of a
business journey on his part. That is&#8212;none of his
business whatever. I tell him fathers should begin
at home and stay there. But father feels differently.
Have you got a husband, Jane? I know that nothing
short of marriage will ever stop him.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> I haven't, Jack. But I almost had an
English one once.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> No need to explain, Jane. They don't exist.
Our men were all killed in the Wars of the Wives.
Father says it was they who started that horrible
Rebellion in this country, and that it's going on still.
Father doesn't believe in matrimony. That's because
you're the first person I've had the heart to broach
the subject to. (<i>Aside.</i>) I don't think I shall ever
marry. It's a fine opportunity for a young man.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> To become your mother, Jack, I might
think of it. But a minister can support anything but
a wife or a sense of humor.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Ah! but if father comes into the estate&#8212;
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> The estate?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Yes, you see when my grandfather died he
left his entire fortune to his second son, at the same
time disinheriting us. Said that when father became
a minister he handled enough tainted money without
hoarding any of his.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> That's too bad, Jack. Not a penny?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> No, just died and damned us.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> He might have left that to his father,
mightn't he?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> So he might. It doesn't make much difference
now though. By the terms of the will he had to
be found, or to find himself, within one year, or the
estate reverted to us. (<i>Pulls out watch.</i>) His time's
almost up I fear.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> You don't think he's dead, do you?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> That or strayed I guess. (<i>Sighs.</i>) He was
always the black sheep of the family.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> It was certainly very good of your father
to come to America to find his brother. Where did
he think he was, do you suppose, in Australia?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Well&#8212;his brother always had an antipathy for
Americans. He married an American! (<i>Enter</i> <span class="sc">Gloria</span>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> <i>is the ordinary middle-aged mortal. In face,
figure and deportment she is like any other middle-class
American woman. All American women belong to the
middle class. They are not all</i> <span class="sc">Glorias</span>, <i>however</i>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span> (<i>flouncing into a chair</i>). Have you seen
Kathryn&#8212;anyone? (<i>Puts the finishing look to a letter;
seals it; then resumes without noticing either one of them.</i>)
I have a very important letter for her.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> I didn't know anything was of importance
to Kathryn, now that she's in love with me.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span> (<i>quietly</i>). Kathryn in love with you? Mr.
Hargrave, you must be mistaken.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> No&#8212;she proposed to me yesterday.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> And did you accept?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> No, I wanted to surprise Kathryn by
refusing, and then to startle her by proposing myself.
This afternoon I have chosen for my surprise. Three
o'clock I think would be the appropriate hour.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> The surprise, Jack, may be yours, but the
romance remains with Kathryn. Eve will out, you
know, and Kathryn has proposed again.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Again! May I ask who it is who has been
so bold as to be proposed to?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Oh, it's still in the family.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> The family?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Yes, Kathryn has proposed to your father.
She said her love for you was of no import, that her
love for your father was based upon degrees of reverential
confidence which marriage alone could be
trusted to dispel.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>rising</i>). I presume, Jane, that you refer to
somebody else's father.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Your very own.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Impossible!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> She recognized him at once.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> How so?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> By his resemblance to you.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Improbable.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Why so?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>seating himself</i>). I have no father.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Of course if you have no father, that settles
it. You have often spoken to us of one, just the same.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> So I have. But he's not a real father.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> What sort of a father is it that's not a
real father?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Oh, mine's adopted.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> You mean that you're an orphan, an adopted
son, or something of the sort?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Yes; father found me; on a Friday.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Found you? On a Friday?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span> (<i>rising</i>). I don't see anything peculiar in
the day at all, Jane. It is one of the seven, and to be
found in all the best calendars. (<i>Brusquely.</i>) Have
you found Kathryn, Jack? (<i>Enter</i> <span class="sc">Dill</span>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> I think I have. I think she's in the next
room. (<i>Edges off C.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> Pardon the contradiction, sir, but Miss
Kathryn is in the Park. Picking convolvulus I think.
Convolvulus very sweet today, sir.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Was she alone, Dill?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill</span> (<i>gaily</i>). No, sir; no, sir. I think she's with
your father, sir. (<i>Retreats before</i> <span class="sc">Jack's</span> <i>glance</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>wheeling about</i>). Foolish father! foolish
father! Really I cannot begin to account for such
conduct on my parent's part. The sense of family
obligation in the old is appallingly on the wane. But
perhaps he's forgotten his glasses. Father's been
wearing glasses for twenty years and performs the
most revolting capers whenever he's without them.
He becomes a boy all over again. (<i>Stands in curtain
way.</i>) Have you got a book on fathers, Jane? Or
perhaps I'll see him from the window. (<i>Stretches
himself out in inner room where he may be observed
throughout remainder of scene.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span> (<i>matter-of-factly</i>). I think a book on daughters
is what you really need, Jane. (<i>Fans herself.</i>) I
need not say that Kathryn has never been a daughter
to you. (<i>They sit facing each other.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Of course not, Gloria. How could she have
been? But Kathryn is my adopted daughter.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span> (<i>very determinedly</i>). Kathryn is not your
daughter at all! Kathryn is my daughter.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> How unexpected, Gloria! Since when did
you discover this?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> I have never discovered it at all, of course.
I have known it from the first.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Then that Friday, that biblical Friday,
twenty years ago, when you came to me with tears
in your eyes&#8212;and a basket and a baby&#8212;
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> I did it for your sake, Jane. I thought it
would add to your character.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Why didn't you adopt Kathryn yourself,
Gloria? You might have done that for your daughter.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> For reasons of my own, and my husband's,
I thought it best to allow you to.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Your child is quite your treasure, Gloria,
you hide it so cleverly. As for your husband, I think
you must have buried him.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> We were married on our trip to London&#8212;yours
and mine. My husband's father did not approve
of the match and our marriage was annulled. Events
which have since transpired allow us to be reunited.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> It seems very strange this, your marrying
your own husband.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span> (<i>radiantly</i>). It is strange, beautifully,
idealistically strange. Oh, you never could believe
me, never!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> I believed you once, Gloria.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span> (<i>turning quickly</i>). In the exact spot where
I said I had found the basket&#8212;
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> And with which Kathryn picks posies now&#8212;
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> It was there that I found the will!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> What will, Gloria?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> The will leaving everything to my husband&#8212;on
condition that we were married&#8212;that is,
left it to us as man and wife.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> So you think the will won't hold?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> Not unless we are married, and immediately.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> It is a great temptation, Gloria, I admit.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> More than that; my husband takes a title.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Oh, I detest titles&#8212;American titles at any
rate. In America a title is the conventional crown
to which the rich and poor alike must bow. Every
professional man, every silly doctor and scientist
holds some title by the hand with which he is clubbing
us on the head. Once we assert ourselves, feel instinctively
that which he never could comprehend, down
comes the cudgel.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> You don't think my husband is going to
beat me?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> I don't know, I can't say.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span> (<i>proudly</i>). My husband is a baronet.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Then probably he will.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> I tell you frankly that my husband is
not going to beat me. The English haven't beaten
anybody in years, and I'm not going to be the first.
(<i>Going closer to her.</i>) Jane, why do you insist upon
calling yourself Jane Gibbs? Would not your husband's
name, or even Mrs. Gibbs, be better? You
must think of Kathryn and your husband.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> My husband?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> Your husband! (<i>Drawing still closer, her
curiosity lending a tone of affection.</i>) Who is your
husband, Jane? I have always been most curious.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane</span> (<i>shrugging her shoulders</i>). Indeed I am sorry,
Gloria. I know that curiosity never should be allowed
to go unanswered, but I have no husband.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span> (<i>at the point of tears</i>). Jane, this is terrible!
I sanctioned Kathryn's adoption believing you at
least had that. What of her? What of your son? I
thought that constant association with my daughter
might arouse some affection for him whom you have
evidently disowned. Have you never thought that
he might want to visit this country, that he might
feel the neglect of the only mother he can call his
own? What of your son!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> My son?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> Your son!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> I have no son.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> Ever since your return from London I
have been told that you had a husband, and you have
told me that you had a son. You said his name was
John.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Suit yourself, Gloria. I have a son.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> And John is now?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane</span> (<i>hesitating&#8212;then with real enthusiasm</i>). At a
School for Socialism in Canterbury.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> A School for Socialism!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Yes, and until John's twentieth year there
is completed he must remain in socialistic hands.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> You are not for socialism, Jane?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> I am not enough interested in myself,
Gloria, to be interested in others. However, I am for
socialism till the advent of socialism, then I shall be
for something else.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> And this school&#8212;had it a founder?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Yes, a Col. Christopher Crapsey. A really
lovable man. The idea was wholly his, and wholly
original too. The school has prospered and is now
one of the largest in England. From all that I hear
John is its prize pupil.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> But are you sure, Jane, that Crapsey is
quite, quite reliable?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> I am never sure of anything, Gloria. But
Crapsey is in this country now and you may judge
for yourself. He wrote me yesterday to say that he
was coming to see me on a matter of importance, of
the very first importance. I suppose he had reference
to John.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> I should never trust any man, Jane.
They give us children and suffering and that is all.
Pain has ever been the path of woman.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> They talk a lot about the pain of women,
Gloria, but it's not so. Slender waists are still the
style.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> Nevertheless I should investigate for
myself.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> And Kathryn&#8212;what would you do about her?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span> (<i>holding up letter</i>). Kathryn will understand
when she has read this. It is from her father
and explains everything.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> I am glad that Kathryn's father is a man of
letters. Few Englishmen can boast of that. But is
Kathryn to become your daughter, or will she remain
with me?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> For twenty years Kathryn has been your
daughter. She has been your daughter and nobody
else's. Kathryn thinks she is your daughter. She
acts like your daughter. (<i>Rises.</i>) And now&#8212;when
I had expected some vast upheaval of your nature,
some evidence of more than a petty affection, you
cast her off for a son whom you have scarcely seen.
You have no maternal instinct whatever.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> I am sorry, Gloria. But when one puts
money into a thing one expects some return&#8212;even
if it is a son. And I have spent a great deal of dollars
on John's education.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> How mercenary you are! And here
Kathryn has barely a stitch on her back. (<i>Enter</i>
<span class="sc">Dill</span>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> That's due to the new fashions, Gloria.
(<i>Clock strikes. Re&#235;nter</i> <span class="sc">Jack</span>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="sc">Gloria</span>). There's a bit of Convolvulus
in the air, my lady. (<span class="sc">Kathryn</span> <i>steals in unnoticed</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> A bit of what, Dill? I've heard that name
before. Have you ever heard of the Convolvulus,
Jack? It sounds as round as a race-track.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>watch in hand</i>). I don't know, Jane. I
haven't followed the flowers for years.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> Oh, it's only an ordinary flower that grows
in the Park. I don't think it even has a smell, but
Dill says I'm named after it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> That's not true, Gloria. There's only one
Convolvulus, and that's Kathryn. I named her that
yesterday. Besides, who ever heard of a Convolvulus
Gloria or a Gloria Convolvulus? It's absurd.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn</span> (<i>emptying flowers over Jack's head</i>). Well,
here are some anyway. A flower for you, Jack. And
mother, a flower for you, too. A Convolvulus for each
of you.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> <i>is picturesque and pretty. A little too
young to be anything but herself, she is nicely original.
Her favorite books are Brieux and Browning, with a
little Tennyson in the summer. She believes in the soul,
and has one.</i>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> You are just in time, Kathryn. I have
something of importance to tell you.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> And I have an important letter for you.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> Oh, mother&#8212;you know how I have
always wanted one. Do you think it could be from&#8212;father?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> I don't know, dear. I'm going to look for
a book on mothers and I'll know more about parents
in general when I come back. (<i>Goes out C.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn</span> (<i>to herself</i>). Of course not; how silly of
me. Why it hasn't even a postage stamp, to say
nothing of a foreign one.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> I shouldn't read it now, dear, anyhow.
(<i>Prepares to go.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> I shouldn't read it at all. I think Gloria
wrote it herself.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> If you have any intention of marrying
Mr. Hargrave, Kathryn, I should advise you to teach
his son better manners. (<i>Exit.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> I'm afraid you're too young, Jack, for me
to ever teach you anything. (<i>Turns her back on him.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>with his back to her</i>). I'm old enough to be
thoroughly cross&#8212;and rebellious, Kathryn.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn</span> (<i>facing about</i>). Jack, you're not, and such
remarks are thoroughly disrespectful. One of the first
lessons in life a young man must learn is never to
rebel against a woman.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> I distinctly rebel against your proposing to
my father. I was with father most of the morning and
took especial pains that he should meet no one. Where
did you find him?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> I discovered him in the Park, Jack.
He was wandering about as aimlessly as a child, and
I am sure had no earthly idea of where he was going.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Yes, father moves very much like a planet
at times, doesn't he? But then I'm not responsible
for his defects. (<i>Nestles beside her.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> I don't think your father has any
defects.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>continuing</i>). And then father's a terrible
failure. But one expects that. The old are all failures.
It is only from a very young man that one demands
immediate, impossible success.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> Before you talk so much about others,
Jack, you might educate yourself a little.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Oh, I don't believe in education, Kathryn.
What has education done for this country? One-hundred-million
Philistines?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> What a silly thing to say, Jack. (<i>Strokes
his hair.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> It makes no difference what one says,
Kathryn, so long as one says something.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> You're very irreverent, Jack. (<i>Pushes
him aside.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Please don't call me Jack! I'd so much
prefer a number.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> A number?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Yes, a number. I know Shakespeare was
thinking of me when he said there was nothing in a
name.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> You're always comparing yourself to
Shakespeare, Jack, and I don't like it. Shakespeare
was a great poet, and you're not even a poet at all.
(<i>Moves away.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>with mock gallantry</i>). The earth should not
always be told it cannot rival the sun.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> That's better.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> But seriously, I do wish I had a number.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> You're not a futurist, Jack?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> I'm far too futile for that. But I believe in
numbers in place of names.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> That's just nonsense, Jack.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> It's not nonsense. Numbers are necessary
and convenient. Moreover, I for one am entirely in
accord with the socialistic idea of the separation of
parent and child. (<i>Rises.</i>) A School for Socialism
is the one thing most needed today&#8212;some place a
child may be put and not molested by its parents,
adopted or otherwise. Each child should have a
number, a perfectly reliable number, one that was
all his own and inherited from no one.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> I don't think your father would like
to hear you talk that way, Jack.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> No, but then you must remember that
father is a back number.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> I don't care.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> No woman ever does. Lack of care is their
distinction.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> And lack of character a man's.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Then you are no longer my Convolvulus?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> It's too late. You had your chance
and didn't take it. Never overlook an opportunity
with a woman, you might change your mind.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Gloria said she was named after that flower,
and I of course denied it. I said that you were my
Convolvulus&#8212;my white Convolvulus.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> I am your father's Convolvulus now,
Jack. What's more, he's coming to tea. (<i>Re&#235;nter</i>
<span class="sc">Jane</span>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Well, of all that's outrageous! Tea? At
this hour? It's three-fifteen, and they're deep in
their dinners in London by now.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> The clock may be set back, Jack. (<i>A pause.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> Jack's father was telling me about
his poor lost brother.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Oh, I'm not so sure that he's poor, or lost
either&#8212;at least not till tomorrow.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Why what do you mean, Jack? You said
he was dead, to me these few minutes ago.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> And your father isn't even looking for
him any longer.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Looking for him? I should say not! When
people look for things they find them. When they
look for children they are successful. And the same
rule applies to brothers. Parents are harder to locate
and it is their redeeming feature. But father has
found his brother! He found him this morning in
the Park&#8212;found him with his own eyes, or rather his
glasses. Father can see anywhere with his glasses,
and nowhere with his eyes. If it were not for his
glasses he'd be like other people.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> I don't believe this imputation against
your father. You think you can win my love by
foully maligning his character and making him appear
as wicked as yourself. But you cannot. I don't
believe one word you have spoken, not one! (<i>Throws
herself on sofa.</i>) Your father doesn't wear glasses!
You have tried to deceive me. (<i>Enter</i> <span class="sc">Gloria</span>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> He has deceived me too. But my charge
is of a more serious nature. Jane herself could not
have been guilty of such conduct. You have tampered
with the dearest thing it is a woman's privilege
to possess. You have mocked that which was only
mine to give and yours to take. You have sullied a
woman's name. (<span class="sc">Jack</span> <i>looks appealing to</i> <span class="sc">Jane</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="sc">Kathryn</span>. <i>Both scorn him.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>on bended knees</i>). Gloria! (<i>His hands are
uplifted in prayer.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span> (<i>holding flower</i>). When I said I was named
after that flower you denied it. But my name is
Gloria and the Convolvulus is mine by baptism.
(<i>Bell rings.</i> <span class="sc">Dill</span> <i>goes out</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> He has been guilty of the grossest deception.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> Of the very grossest deception. We
could never trust him now. (<i>They lock arms and
saunter across the stage together.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> He has! The Convolvulus is nothing
but a Morning Glory, and I was named after it. If
I were not so very stationary I should pick some
now. I should pick a whole bundle of them.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn</span> (<i>most severely</i>). Your father does not
wear glasses. You must promise never to say such a
thing again.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> And to think that of all days father should
have chosen this one to forget his glasses.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Love is blind, Jack. (<i>Enter</i> <span class="sc">Dill</span> <i>out of
breath</i>.) Perhaps that explains it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> Mr. Hargrave, Miss Kathryn.
</p>

<p>
<i>A white flower peeps clumsily from Hargrave's
buttonhole. He wears the usual vest and has the unusual
voice of a member of the clergy. His hair is long, and
as he has apparently forgotten his glasses, he stands in
the doorway quite, quite confused.</i>
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn</span> (<i>running up to him</i>). Oh, you dear,
dear man! (<i>Takes his hand.</i>) Of course you don't
wear them, do you? (<i>Calling.</i>) Jack, let me introduce
you to your father. Mr. Hargrave, let me introduce
you to your son.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>groping about and wiping his forehead
uneasily</i>). My son?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> Jack&#8212;your father!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> I am not his son, and he is not my father.
I consider his presence an intrusion, a disgrace. You
shall be unfrocked, sir, at the first opportunity.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>marching up to Jane</i>). How dare you,
sir! How dare you speak so disrespectfully of your
father!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Mr. Hargrave, I am not your son&#8212;although
you certainly do look familiar. (<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> <i>has
floundered to the other end of the room and is being cared
for by</i> <span class="sc">Dill</span>, <i>who mops his face with a big handkerchief</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> I know, father, there's great suffering among
the rich in this hot weather. Do you think you'd
still care to marry him, Jane?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> I'm not sure, Jack. Your father looks
very much like someone I almost married before.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Ah, in that case you'd hardly care to repeat
the experiment. (<i>Waves to them.</i>) Goodbye, Kathryn.
Come soon and find his glasses.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> No, I'd rather read my letter.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> I'm not a bad looker, Jack. And I have a
new high hat which reaches to Heaven.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> No more than mine, Jane. It's from the
Alps. (<i>Takes his arm.</i>) This way, father. You
don't drink tea anyway. (<i>They go out.</i> <span class="sc">Jane</span> <i>strolls
off</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="sc">Dill</span>). Do you think, Dill, do you
think that a man could ever be a success in life, I
mean a real success like you have, who wore glasses?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> In my capacity, Miss Kathryn, I have often
wished I wore them. There are so many things it's
best not to see too clearly.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn</span> (<i>with a relieved sigh</i>). Oh, that's all right
then. (<i>She disappears.</i> <span class="sc">Gloria</span> <i>and</i> <span class="sc">Dill</span> <i>are left
quite, quite alone</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill</span> (<i>after a pause</i>). Your debut&#8212;and that about
the Convolvulus&#8212;was very sweet, my dear.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> Thank you, Dill.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> On the contrary, Mr. Hargrave's entrance
failed to come up to expectations.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span> (<i>sternly</i>). No, Dill. But men never do,
and Mr. Hargrave can render us a distinct service
later. You forget that we must be married.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> Is it really to come true, love?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> Of course, Dill. And now are you quite
ready?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> Quite, my love.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> Are your hands clean?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill</span> (<i>taking hers in his</i>). No man's could be
cleaner.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span> (<i>smoothing his hair</i>). I don't think you
brushed your hair, Dill.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> It's a pleasure to hear you say that, dear.
I have always noticed that when men and women
tire of each other they become very careless of each
other's appearance.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> Then you do love me, Dill?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> Oh, my love. (<i>Embraces her passionately.</i>)

<i>Scene</i>&#8212;<span class="sc">Peter Hargrave's</span> <i>apartment. Door R.
Exit L. Narrow hall U. R. with door L. An old-fashioned
bell rope overhead; double desk, two chairs,
and a Venus on the wall. Enter</i> <span class="sc">Jack</span> <i>escorting</i> <span class="sc">Hargrave</span>
<i>by the arm</i>.
</p>
<br>


<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> If it were my own father, he could not
have acted in a more gentlemanly manner. Your
every movement marks you the gentleman. You
have a gentleman's happy faculty for doing the wrong
thing at the right time. I have always feared that
some day I should meet a gentleman, but never, never
suspected you. (<i>They come down stage together.</i>) Dill
said his brother was a gentleman, but no one believes
Dill, no one but myself. (<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> <i>is doing his best
to overlook</i> <span class="sc">Jack's</span> <i>frivolity</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> I must confess that I am glad my
brother has been found out. What did you say his
social standing was?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>using Venus as a mirror</i>). A butler, father.
The standing is on a par with petty theft.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> A butler! A thief!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Yes, a menial, father, a form of man. It
owes its origin to menus.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>rubbing his hands</i>). I haven't told you
before, my boy, and an announcement of this kind
should really proceed from the young lady in question,
but I believe that I am engaged.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Of course, you are, father. I'm attending
to that.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> Then Kathryn has told you?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Kathryn? This is the last straw, father.
(<i>Pulls quill pen from hat.</i>) You shall be unfrocked,
sir. (<i>Sits down at desk.</i>) I'll write a brief to the
Archbishop to that effect. (<i>Does not write.</i>) I had
long seen the advisability of such action, and had you
been my real father would have attended to it long
ago. (<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> <i>glares at him</i>.) When would you
be unfrocked, father? In the morning? I'll respect
any preference you see fit to name. Well, some morning!
Most any morning will do. Letters have to
travel like other people. They would not be well read
otherwise.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>at other end of the desk</i>). You shall go
to jail, sir. (<i>Writes furiously.</i>) Or maybe there are
many charitable organizations only too glad to take
you off my hands.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> That remark was cowardly, Mr. Kent.
You know very well that I am not rich enough to go
to jail, and that both influence and position are
required today for a jail career. (<i>Snatches pen away.</i>)
For the past fortnight a jail has been my prime
ambition. I have a genius for jails, and I need
not tell you, Mr. Kent, that I need rest and
affection.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> Hargrave, Jack, Hargrave! And until
tonight I must be known by no other name.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Please don't call me Jack, father. It sounds
so unartificial. And to think that I who have always
perceived the immense superiority of a number,
should have been endowed with a monosyllable like
that.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> You had a number once, Jack.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> A number! Is it true, father, or do my
ears deceive me?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>piously</i>). I shall endeavor to spare
your feelings as far as possible. A young man tasting
too soon of the bitter fruits of life is apt to form a
very wrong impression of this world of ours, and the
inhabitants above it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Oh, people are above everything in this
world, father, and in the next too, I guess. But have
I got a number?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> How little you understand! You
think that I refer to some social distinction, some
news of your misguided parents. I refer to your
real parents, Jack. An immoral longing I have
never had.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Oh, everyone's as moral and immoral as he
knows how to be, father.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>expostulating</i>). Jack! Jack!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> How often must I tell you not to call me
that, sir. Even John were better.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>devoutly</i>). It was no desire of mine to
dig up the past, to unearth that which belonged
rightly to the dead. Your conduct, however, has
made the telling inevitable.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> A telling speech, father. But tell me, have
I got a number?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>bitterly</i>). You have, sir! You have!
Allow me to tell you, sir, that you once were, and I
have no doubt still are, undutifully registered at
Crapsey Hall, Canterbury, under the charge of an
abominable brute by that name, as John&#8212;plain John,
Disciple No. 1, in an evil establishment known as a
School for Socialism.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>embracing him wildly</i>). Father! I forgive
you! Everything! (<i>Kissing him.</i>) Turn the other
cheek, father. Oh, such luck, such luck! I'll return
at once. My fortune and future are assured now.
(<i>Tosses his cap into the air.</i>) And to think that of
all numbers, I should have been No. 1.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>kindly</i>). You are surely an odd number,
Jack.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Dear Crapsey! I wonder how he came to
give me that particular number, or if he knew that I
thought of no one but myself?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> I stole you from that heathen Hell&#8212;
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Yes, yes, father.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> And you were the first, last, and only
little devil ever entered there.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>crushed</i>). Oh!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> So come, let's to more serious things.
You said my brother was getting married?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> It's a man's malady, father.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>suddenly</i>). Jack! I have a thought!
(<i>Steps forward.</i>) Could it be possible?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> You slight yourself, father.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>meditating</i>). He is not marrying out
of love. No! My brother would never do that. He
must be marrying out of his&#8212;
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Out of his senses, father. All men do
that.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>gyrating in circles</i>). The will! the will!
Oh, he must know, he must! The estate was left to
him on condition that he was married, and that's
why he's marrying now. (<i>Pulls large pair of colored
glasses from his pocket.</i>) The will! Show me the
will!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> I knew you hadn't lost them. The old
rarely lose anything. They have nothing to lose.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>teeming with excitement</i>). The will!
the will!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>reaching in hip pocket, coat pocket, hip pocket</i>).
Yes, father. (<i>Repeats the experiment.</i>) No, father.
(<i>Subsides into chair.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> Oh, Jack! He has found it&#8212;we are lost.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>springing to his feet</i>). No, it's not lost. I
remember, you remember, it is under the tree. I left
it in the Park this morning.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> No!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Yes. (<i>Makes for door&#8212;returns deliberately.</i>)
You agree to behave in my absence, father? I am very
popular these days, and if Jane or Kathryn should
happen in&#8212;
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> Jane! Did you say Jane! I have a
particular aversion to that name, Jack. I trust that
no woman named Jane bears any relationship to
Kathryn?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Only her mother.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> Her mother? Her name, please! Even
now I trace a resemblance, a terrible resemblance.
Tell me her name!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Her name's the same as Kathryn's, of course.
I only ask you to leave the whole family alone hereafter.
They did not even know you existed until this
afternoon. You were a creation of my fancy and had
form, color and expression. And now you have ruined
it all. All, father, because you will not wear your
glasses.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> I don't know Kathryn's name. She
never told me and I never asked.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Kathryn's name is Kathryn Gibbs, her
aunt's name is Gloria Gibbs, and her mother's name
is Jane Gibbs. Jane's a jewel, Gloria's an idiot, and
Kathryn's mine. Have you learned all that you
want now, or must I tell you more?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>in a most melancholy voice</i>). Jack,
this is terrible. I had never expected that. Jane
Gibbs!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> The name's no worse than Jack, father.
Too bad Jane's not a socialist, and could exchange for
a number.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> She is a socialist, Jack. Oh, a horrible,
horrible socialist! Did I never tell you of a woman?
whose views of life&#8212;
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Are not so antiquated as your own, sir?
(<i>There comes a tinkle of the bell, a second and a third.</i>)
But come, father, one should always give in to the
inevitable, and I have chosen Jane as your most likely
spouse.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> I will not marry that woman! I will
not! (<span class="sc">Jack</span> <i>throws open the door and</i> <span class="sc">Jane</span> <i>enters.
She has on a gown of many colors and a hat of many
heights.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Ah, Jane! So glad to see you! I've just
been speaking to father about that matter we discussed
and he's quite interested already. Fact is,
father's always interested, though interesting he is not.
I've taken him to task about that blunder, though.
Father's a bull for blunders. In the morning I've
suggested that he be unfrocked. You'll be there of
course? Great sight. (<i>Facing about.</i>) Why don't you
say something, father! Or should fathers be seen and
not heard? But perhaps you desire an introduction.
Jane&#8212;my father. My father&#8212;Jane Gibbs. (<i>Each
are about to shake hands, but</i> <span class="sc">Jack's</span> <i>body intervenes and
he rambles on</i>.) The family problem is the most
important product of this age, and ranks even higher
than the servant question. Of course, fathers were
fashionable at one time, or I never should have had
one. It's a great fault, though, I admit.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane</span> (<i>loosening wrap</i>). My faults are my fortune,
Jack. Some people are even famous for them.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Ravishing, Jane, ravishing! (<i>Plays with
dress, avoiding</i> <span class="sc">Hargrave</span>.) But perhaps I should go.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Probably you should go, Jack.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> It is not problematical at all. It is
obvious, sir. (<span class="sc">Jack</span> <i>runs around the table</i>.) My son
has a roving nature, Jane; it is almost poetical. I've
just advised an interview with a certain tree, a rather
poetical tree. He is a near poet, you know.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>bowing</i>). A minor poet only, not yet being
of age.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Do not make fun of the minor poets, Jack.
Leave that to the newspapers. They foster them.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>apologetic</i>). My son had good intentions.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Heaven is filled with good intentions, father.
(<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Jane</span>.) Chesterton says that poets are a trouble
to their families. But then Chesterton is always
wrong. If the families of real poets are anything like
mine, the trouble rests with them.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Hurry, Jack, the tree may be gone. (<i>Crosses
L. and seats herself in the armchair.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> My interview will prove a very short one.
(<i>Pulls out watch.</i>) Before long, father, I shall expect
you to have arranged everything.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>in a conciliatory manner</i>). You said
that her sister was an idiot, did you not?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> I did, father.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>writing on cuff</i>). It may prove of
importance. (<i>Shuts door on him. A whistling sound is
heard as</i> <span class="sc">Jack</span> <i>leisurely descends the stairs</i>. <span class="sc">Hargrave</span>
<i>returns to</i> <span class="sc">Jane</span>. <i>Her taking the larger chair upsets
him very much. There is a moment's lapse in which
they look at each other.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> How very still it is here, Peter. I feel
almost as if I were in the country&#8212;in the country
that we both knew so well before our hearts had
learned to beat.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>rising to the sentimentality of the occasion</i>).
My heart is bigger than its beat, Jane.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Ah, but you have been in this country
many days, and you never once wrote to tell me.
We should have been glad to see you, all of us, even
Dill&#8212;that's my butler&#8212;but he's almost one of the
family.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>scowling</i>). I came to America from a
sense of duty, Jane, and it has completely absorbed
my time. I came to find my brother.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> You never told me you had a brother. You
left that for your son to do.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> Then Jack has told you.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Yes.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> The fact is, Jane, that I have never
spoken very much of my brother to anyone. The
poor fellow eloped just before I met you, and our
recollection of him has always been a sad one. Sadder
still has been my present duty to investigate and find
that he is dead.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane</span> (<i>ironically</i>). The Peter Kent that I knew had
very little sense of duty. Often I thought that he
had none at all. But he was not the Peter Hargrave
that I see now. He was not a minister, and he did
not lie. He was not a hypocrite and he did not
masquerade under a false name to swindle his own
brother, his living brother whom he pretended to think
dead.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>surprised and sullen</i>). It is not
true.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> It is true! Your son told me.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> Jack is not my son. He is only mine
by adoption.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> He told me that too, but he also told me
about your brother. You met him this very morning
in the Park.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> I admit that. But till this very
morning I believed my brother was dead, as dead
as my own father is today. And now how does he
show himself! As a man with whom one would care
to associate? (<i>With sudden inspiration.</i>) No, as a
thief, an unrepentant, petty thief; and Jack will tell
you that also.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane</span> (<i>a little taken aback</i>). How did you happen
to call him Jack, Peter? I think John were infinitesimally
nicer.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> Jack would hardly have had a name
at all if it hadn't been for me. He might have had
nothing but a number.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> A number?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> Yes, a number! I found him the very
morning after you sailed, Jane, a babe in arms, bound
heart and soul to a School for Socialism.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane</span> (<i>eagerly</i>). A School for Socialism! Where,
Peter?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>complacently</i>). At Canterbury, under
the direction of&#8212;
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane</span> (<i>beside herself with excitement</i>). Of a most
eminent man, a charming gentleman by the name of&#8212;
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> Under the direction of a wholly worthless,
degraded rascal, who has dogged my footsteps
from that day to this, who has even threatened my
life, and who has been the one and only cause of my
assuming the name of Hargrave.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> His name?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> His name is Crapsey! And he has
even followed me to this country.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Oh! (<i>Sinks into chair.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> When I stole him from that pernicious
place, his sole mark of identification was John, plain
John, Disciple No. 1, in Crapsey's School for Socialism.
(<i>Bell rings overhead.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> You stole him, Peter, and your act was as
free to censure as any committed by your brother.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> Ssh!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> I won't be still. I want to tell you right
now.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>terrified</i>). There's someone at the
door.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> I don't care. They can hear too if they
want to. (<i>Gets up.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> Consider my position, Jane. I couldn't
really ... I couldn't have a woman in my
rooms. There, there, now! (<i>Takes her arm.</i>) You
are all flushed&#8212;and the rouge is beginning to come
off. (<span class="sc">Jane</span> <i>instantly subsides</i>.) This is my son's
room. You may rest here for a while ... or
at least until my visitors have gone. (<i>Bowing complacently.</i>)
Love lingers in the spring and doubtless
they are only some happy couple tasting for the first
time that desire for the fruits of marriage which is
the divine purport of our youth. (<i>Shuts door securely
on her. Sighs with relief and wipes his glasses carefully.
Then after a moment's conflict with his vanity, returns
and places them on the table. This done he tiptoes to
the door and apparently observing but one person, shouts
down the stairs.</i>) Come in, sir! (<span class="sc">Dill's</span> <i>head appears
immediately through the opening, quite startling</i> <span class="sc">Hargrave</span>
<i>who retreats before it</i>. <span class="sc">Dill</span> <i>still wears knickerbockers
and a wondrous black cape falls from his massive
shoulders. On second appearance he is followed by</i>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span>, <i>dressed in her very best and carrying a large
colored satchel. She is somewhat out of sorts at the
delay and is coaxed and fondled by</i> <span class="sc">Dill</span>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>bowing</i>). Ah, two strolling minstrels,
I perceive.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill</span> (<i>punctiliously</i>). No, sir. No, sir. We understood
that you were a minister, sir.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>his hands clasped behind his back</i>). My
heart and home are ever at the disposal of my
flock.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> (<i>motioning</i> <span class="sc">Dill</span> <i>to be still</i>). You'll excuse
the nature of our visit, sir, but you see my husband
(<i>blushes a little</i>)&#8212;or rather I should have said the
man who is to be my husband&#8212;
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="sc">Gloria</span>). Both, my love, both.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span> (<i>bluntly</i>). There was no time to be lost and
we must get married.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> Ah, love is a tender thing, and her
call is always urgent.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> I overheard your son observe that you are
to be unfrocked, sir&#8212;and so we just thought we'd
take you while there was still time. (<i>Aside.</i>) There's
only one time for marriage, and that's when the lady
gives her consent.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>now scowling and suspicious</i>). My
son?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> Dillingham, you are always rendering
the most unpleasant surprises. (<i>At mention of his
brother's name</i>, <span class="sc">Hargrave</span> <i>stands stupefied, then with
a fleeting glance over his shoulder, rushes back to the
table and adjusts his glasses</i>.) Perhaps Mr. Hargrave
does not care to acknowledge that he has a son, and
what you said about being unfrocked was ungentlemanly.
(<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> <i>glares at</i> <span class="sc">Dill</span> <i>and stations himself
in front of</i> <span class="sc">Jane's</span> <i>door</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>trembling with emotion</i>). Do I understand,
sir, that you trespass upon my hearth entertaining
visions of matrimony? (<span class="sc">Dill</span> <i>and</i> <span class="sc">Gloria</span>
<i>are stupefied by</i> <span class="sc">Hargrave's</span> <i>peculiar behavior</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill</span> (<i>very sweetly</i>). That's it, sir.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> Then I take pleasure to inform you,
sir, that it cannot be done.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> But it must be done, sir. I have made a
careful canvass of the ministry, and I find them all
to be extinct at present, sir. They're like the birds
and butterflies, sir, and are forever migrating at this
season of the year. You're the only one that hasn't
wings at present, sir.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> Be quiet, Dill. It's love that makes the
world go around, Mr. Hargrave.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> It's love that makes the world stand
still, I say. Besides, in this country at least marriage
is illegal. The Constitution expressly provides that no
man shall be deprived of the right of health, happiness,
and the pursuit of freedom.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> That's why we are going to change the
Constitution, Mr. Hargrave.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> Anyway there's no room here. A
correct marriage requires space for tears and relatives.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill</span> (<i>in the corner</i>). I think we might try it here,
sir.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>superciliously</i>). I am not in favor of
trial marriages. Marriage itself is responsible for
the alarming decrease in the birth-rate so prevalent
throughout the world.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span> (<i>sweetly</i>). I think Mr. Hargrave is superstitious,
dear.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>snatching at the straw</i>). I am. I am.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> I always try to harbor superstitions in the
heart, sir, and to remove them as far from the mind
as possible.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>advancing with a crafty smile</i>). Ah,
well! So be it then. My own experience with marriage
is limited. However I will say this much for it. If
it weren't for marriage a man could not honorably
part with a woman.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span> (<i>in a low voice</i>). I said Mr. Hargrave was
the proper person to apply to, Dill.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> We will first examine the license.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> License?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>in the most insulting manner</i>). All
women are not licensed in this country I am sorry to
say. In that the continental custom is far better.
However, before they are married they must be
licensed. At any rate do you think we should have
them running around at large?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> Here is the license, sir.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>examining it critically</i>). I don't see
your ages here.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> We are both forty. (<span class="sc">Gloria</span> <i>is about to
remonstrate</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> Hm&#8212;really, sir, I must object to that.
I myself am forty and should not dream of marrying
yet. You are both far too young.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> If you insist, sir, I am a little over forty.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>squinting</i>). And your names are?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> Gloria Gibbs.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> Sir John Dillingham Kent.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> Do I infer that you are a gentleman?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> Oh, yes, sir. Even my brother was that.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> And your social standing?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span> (<i>whispering loudly</i>). Bart, Dill, Bart!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> Br ... butler.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> That settles it. I cannot marry a
butler posing as a gentleman. (<i>Acts as if about to show
them out.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> There is nothing in the Bible which says
anything against marrying a butler, Mr. Hargrave.
Pharaoh's chief adviser was a butler, as you yourself
know. (<i>There is no Bible to be seen and she stares at</i>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> <i>deprecatingly</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>eyeing</i> <span class="sc">Dill</span> <i>as if choking would be a
pleasure</i>). And Pharaoh hung him by the neck, if I
am not mistaken.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> The baker, sir, the baker. Very mixing
indeed, sir.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> As God is my baker&#8212;I mean my maker&#8212;I
swear that I will have nothing further to do with
the case. Under the most favorable conditions I can
imagine my marrying a butler, or even a baker, for
that matter, but with due respect to you, Miss Gibbs,
I must (<i>glances at cuff</i>) decline to marry a butler, or
even Pharaoh himself, to an idiot. The laws of hygiene
govern that.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> Sir!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> My son has already informed me,
Miss Gibbs, that you are an idiot, and I for one
refuse to perform at any ceremony in which you are
the principal.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span> (<i>opening satchel</i>). Mediocrity may be the
foundation of my family, sir, but idiocy is not. However,
I was prepared for that. I have found your
son something of a clever idiot himself, and first
accurate deductions led me to the belief that his
father would be also. (<i>Pulls out paper.</i>) I have here
complete and accurate credentials to certify that I
have never suffered from Christian Science, Mental
Science, Physical Science, Woman Suffrage, Eugenics,
or any of the other seven deadly diseases so prevalent
amongst my sex. I have also fully recorded a
memorandum of the character and chief events of
my life, including ventilation, vivisection, vaccination,
marriage&#8212;
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> Marriage! (<i>He gazes profoundly at
them.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> This is my second marriage, Mr. Hargrave.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill</span> (<i>apologetically</i>). We have both been married
before, sir. You see, sir&#8212;
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> I see. Are you calling attention to
my glasses?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> The fact is that we have each been married
to each other, sir.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>drawing himself haughtily together</i>). Am
I to gather that that is any evidence of her sanity? I
say it's absurd. Any scientist in the country will
tell you that a perfectly sane, healthy, well-organized
marriage must end somewhere. All things do, and
marriages have the habit, good or otherwise, of ending
in divorce. It's their affinity.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> Ah! But our marriage was annulled, sir.
(<i>Looks about him confident that victory is won.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> To you, sir, I owe an apology. When
I informed Miss Gibbs of my decision in this important
case, I had entirely overlooked you. Your marriage
was annulled, you say?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> I do, sir.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> And you are starting proceedings all
over again?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill</span> (<i>now dubious of his mastery of the situation</i>).
Yes, sir.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> In that event I substantially alter my
original assertion. I said she was an idiot, did I not?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> And I can prove to the contrary, Mr.
Hargrave.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> Any man or woman, not willing, but
eager&#8212;as you have both shown yourselves to be&#8212;to
repeat so dangerous an experiment, is clearly removed
from that extremity of the body which we call mind.
It is not a question of one idiot&#8212;you are both idiots.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> Is not that a bit of an exaggeration, sir?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> I think not.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> I am sorry that Mr. Hargrave's son is not
here, love. I know he would marry us.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> It's no use, Dill. Show Mr. Hargrave
the will, and explain why we must be married. (<i>Sound
of</i> <span class="sc">Jack</span> <i>on the stairs</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> Yes, the will! Show me the will!
(<i>Reaches out for it.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Father! I cannot find it! The will is lost!
(<i>Bursts upon them.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span> (<i>after a painful pause</i>). What will, Mr.
Hargrave? You seem extremely nervous. Can there
be any relation between your will and ours? (<span class="sc">Hargrave</span>
<i>looks very faint</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> I don't know if there is any relation between
the wills, my dear, but Mr. Jack said that his father
took me for his brother. Of course Mr. Hargrave
didn't know that my name was Kent. However, I
had an uncle named Hargrave, and in case my brother
is dead, one half of the estate shall be his.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>buoyant at this turn of affairs</i>). I am
Peter Kent, your brother, your long missing brother!
(<i>Embraces him.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> When a woman does not change her
name for love she does so for money. It is true sometimes
of a man. I see now why Mr. Hargrave changed
his name and why he refuses to marry us. He shall
not get a cent. (<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Dill</span>.) I think that you knew
all the while that Mr. Hargrave was your brother,
and that you chose to be married by a thief. (<span class="sc">Hargrave's</span>
<i>expression has changed</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane</span> (<i>stepping out</i>). Mr. Hargrave changed his
name solely for my sake. We are going to be married,
and I preferred Hargrave to Kent. That may be
remedied, however. As for his brother&#8212;he did think
him dead for he told me so himself.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> You have done this for my sake?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> For whoever's sake you did it, Jane, I
am glad you have got a husband at last&#8212;even if
you did it for your own. Come, Dill.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> I should like to spend a few moments with
my brother, my own.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> Well, not more than a very few moments.
(<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Jane</span>.) The two dears look absolutely alike, and
when you get tired of yours we might change them
around a bit.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Are you coming, Jack?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> I'm tired of all this moving around, Jane.
I haven't sat down for five minutes.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Well, just to the door. (<i>They go out.</i> <span class="sc">Dill</span>
<i>seats himself comfortably in the big chair</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> Charming little artificial nook here. Shaw
says&#8212;
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> Do not jest about artificial things, sir.
Browne avers that all things are artificial, nature being
only the art of God.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> Browne! Browne! No relation to Browning,
sir? Pardon me. Of course; Browning's the diminutive,
Browne naturally the father.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> Of no relationship whatever. I had
reference to Sir Thomas Browne.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> Ah! A man with a title. One of God's
favorites, sir, and possibly some relation of my own.
(<i>Enter</i> <span class="sc">Kathryn</span>. <i>She is very much out of breath and
holds an open letter in her hand.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn</span> (<i>between gasps</i>). Of course, I always
knew I had a father. Every young girl has, and it
would be considered most unnatural not to. (<i>She is
shielded by the angle of the room from</i> <span class="sc">Dill</span>.) And I
always knew he was a horrid, horrid, man, too. Aunt
Gloria confessed that. (<span class="sc">Dill</span>, <i>hearing</i> <span class="sc">Kathryn's</span>
<i>voice, has risen</i>.) But at least I thought he was a gentleman
(<span class="sc">Dill</span> <i>takes a step toward her</i>), and I never, never
dreamed it could be Dill. (<i>They come face to face.</i>)
Oh! (<i>Turns away.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>turning threateningly</i>). What is your
social standing, Dill, I forget?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill</span> (<i>abashed and discomforted</i>). A butler, sir.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> Don't cry, dear, Dill is only a butler
after all, and not at all responsible for what he does.
(<span class="sc">Kathryn</span> <i>had not thought of crying&#8212;but</i> <span class="sc">Hargrave</span>
<i>thought she should have</i>.) It is your mother who is
to blame&#8212;your mother! That will do, Dill. (<i>Forcing
him back.</i>) This is the servant's exit.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill</span> (<i>absolutely unhappy</i>). Miss Kathryn, let me
explain!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> You may explain to Miss Gibbs,
Dill; perhaps she will defer marrying you now.
(<i>Pushes him out.</i> <span class="sc">Dill</span> <i>carries a wounded look away
with him</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill</span> (<i>clattering down the stairs</i>). My brother was a
gentleman. (<span class="sc">Jane</span> <i>and</i> <span class="sc">Jack</span> <i>enter leisurely by the
front</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>taking in situation at a glance</i>). Is this your
work, sir? Have you proposed to her again, or what?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="sc">Jane</span>). Kathryn is for the first
time aware of her father. I need not say that neither
butler nor baker is considered the thing in a family
way. To find such a man one's brother is indeed an
unpleasant surprise, but to find him one's father
must be a tragedy. We both feel the blow more
deeply than you think.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn</span> (<i>very haughtily</i>). You need not feel the
blow at all, Mr. Hargrave. I am already half resigned
to my parent, and by tomorrow I have no doubt that
he will be in good standing again. My only regret
from the first was that you cannot take his place,
and that Dill can now be nothing more than a father
to me.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>taking her arm</i>). There, there, my dear!
All fathers are terrible, and I know yours could never
be as bad as mine. (<i>He regards no one but her.</i>) I
positively never think of anything he says unless by
accident, nor must you either. And should the very
worst come to pass you must always console yourself
by remembering that we are none of us responsible
for the species, either adopted or otherwise. (<i>They go
out.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> Kathryn took her father very nicely.
(<i>Sets himself for a scene.</i>) I am sorry I do not share
her strength.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> One-half of strength is weakness.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> And the other half?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> That is weakness.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> It is obvious, Jane, that you are
incorrigible. Your daughter did not bid you good-bye.
Can you blame her? This social evil, Jane, is far
more than a harmless pleasure, as you once expressed
it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane</span> (<i>languidly</i>). Kathryn is not my daughter.
She is my adopted daughter. Gloria is her mother.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>beside her</i>). Jane, forgive me! How
could I have guessed?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> You are far too serious, Peter. Perhaps it
is something that you eat.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> I swallowed a whole tooth yesterday. I
don't know just what the consequences are going to be.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> You may get a tooth-ache, Peter. And
again you may go to the dentist's.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> I'd rather go to the dogs, Jane. I
have already a hundred holes in my head that were
made by those fellows.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane</span> (<i>running her hands through his hair</i>). Your
hair is long, Peter; far too long for married life. I
have a marvellous tonic. It was recommended to me
by no less than three physicians, and is guaranteed
to make your hair fall out so quickly that you will
positively never have to have it cut.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> I remember it all now, Jane&#8212;the
fields that we wandered together&#8212;and the Convolvulus,
that little white flower that we picked and loved.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Recite that about the lilies of the field, and
the birds of the sky, will you, Peter? It was always
my favorite.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> I didn't suppose you knew so much
about the Bible, Jane.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> I know something of birds, Peter.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> You have always been my Convolvulus,
Jane. Can you believe that?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> It's a funny thing, Peter, but in love one
never doubts, and the loved one never tells the truth.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>suddenly</i>). How beautiful you are,
Jane! You look just as you did in the days of old&#8212;with
your little hands and feet.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane</span> (<i>jumping up and covering them</i>). Oh, my
feet have grown, Peter.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> I remember, Jane; in the olden days
you would do anything but marry me.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Now that is the only thing I will do for you.

<p>
<i>Scene&#8212;Reverting to Act I.</i> <span class="sc">Dill</span> <i>and</i> <span class="sc">Gloria</span> <i>facing
each other</i>. (<i>They are surrounded by two diminutive

</p>
<br>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> Let us read the will again, dear.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span> (<i>pompously</i>). "Regretting my anger and
the annulment of his marriage&#8212;to my second son,
John Dillingham Kent, be he found to have married
any woman, good, bad or indifferent, the same wife

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> "To him I hereby bequeath my honorable
title of baronet, conferred upon me by the crown
as a reward for my stand against the nefarious practise
of socialism, particularly that which has broken out
and appeared on the point of flourishing in ye good and
ancient city of Canterbury. Also to himself and wife,
do they make known their identity within one year's

<span class="sc">Dill.</span> You may ride the pigs, my lady.

"Forty-three geese, seven singing birds, nine parrots

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> "To my only other relation, the Rev.
Peter Kent, who much to my displeasure has taken
upon himself that right of interpreting the Lord's
intentions on earth, I give nothing. He is an undutiful
son, but should he still possess one spark of parental
affection, let him go forth to America, that land of
beautiful women, and by diligent search for his own
beloved brother, prove himself worthy of no title at all,
but the rank of a gentleman." (<i>Hands</i> <span class="sc">Dill</span> <i>the will</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> Am I a gentleman? (<i>Bows like a courtier.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> Yes, Dill.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> Is he a gentleman?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> No, Dill.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill</span> (<i>decisively</i>). He shall have nothing.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> No, Dill.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> Nor the chickens, nor the cows, nor even
one of the&#8212;what was that derivation, my dear?

</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> Yes, love.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> Do not make fun of the Germans, Dill, I
had an aunt born in Germany and I fear she is living yet.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> Can they neither live nor die in Germany,
my sweet?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> I think not, Dill.... But would
you not even give him one teeney-weeney pig? (<span class="sc">Dill</span>
<i>stands in front of</i> <span class="sc">Gloria</span>, <i>seriously debating this all-important
matter</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill</span> (<i>at length</i>). No, my love.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> Not one, Dill? Think of the sorrow we
have already caused him! There are two misfortunes
in life. One is to find one's relations quite, quite
dead. The other is, as one generally does, to find
them quite, quite, alive.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill</span> (<i>moodily</i>). He said I was not a gentleman and
shall get nothing.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span> (<i>rising</i>). Ah, Dill, you would not be vindictive?
I could never believe my husband guilty of
that. Moreover, I have a vast superabundance of
money myself.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill</span> (<i>shocked and hurt</i>). Oh, my love! You might
have told me, even if you did not give me any.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> It was necessary that you, of all people,
should know nothing of it. People would have thought
you were marrying me for money.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill</span> (<i>not wholly reconciled</i>). True, true.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> I have something to tell you.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> Concerning me?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> No, it is a very sensitive subject. I
don't think that either of us has mentioned it since
the day that we were born; and Jane has aged so
rapidly that it would seem absurd on the surface of
things&#8212;but she and I are twins.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> One soon becomes reconciled to realities,
my dear. (<i>Sighs and looks at his jacket.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> It has taken me more than twenty years
to become reconciled to you, Dill. But now for a
surprise. (<i>She goes R.</i>, <span class="sc">Dill</span> <i>following solemnly behind
her. He is like a big St. Bernard dog following his mistress.</i>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span> <i>tramps back</i>, <span class="sc">Dill</span> <i>again several paces

gold.</i>) I was forty yesterday. Now all this is mine.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill</span> (<i>with a lump in his throat</i>). Yes, my love.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> So you are not yet independent, Dill.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill</span> (<i>swallowing his unhappiness</i>). No, my love.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> It was left me by my father.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> Ah, I see. And Jane?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> No. (<i>Whispering.</i>) I think my sister got
nothing. I was always my father's favorite daughter.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill</span> (<i>discarding his jacket</i>). I am no longer a butler.
No, I will not. My brother may be a butler if you like.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span> (<i>sharply</i>). Dill!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill</span> (<i>forgetting his good resolutions</i>). Yes, my love.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> We have lived here very happily, Dill.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> And now I will build you a castle among the
clouds. We will be like the moon and the stars.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> Aeroplaning is out of fashion, Dill.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> As you would have it, my love.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> For twenty years you have executed my
orders.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill</span> (<i>with revived ardor</i>). And now a hundred men
shall do your bidding! We will go to the extreme ends
of the earth&#8212;
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> I do not approve of extremes of any
kind, Dill. The most important thing in life is that
whatever a young man once starts he should see to
the end.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> But I hold a title, my sweet.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> No matter. You were not born with it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> I never heard of a titled butler. (<i>Shakes his
head dubiously.</i>) My brother has not got a title.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span> (<i>sharply</i>). Dill! Do you love me?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> Ah, how could you doubt it?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> I have never doubted it. I was only
testing you. (<i>Hands him bag.</i>) All this is yours, Dill.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> My love, my love. (<i>Kneels.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> On condition that you continue to serve
me as faithfully as you have in the past.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill</span> (<i>clasping her hands</i>). Ah, my beloved one!
Light of my life! Blessed of women! (<i>His head sinks
upon her lap. Enter</i> <span class="sc">Kathryn</span> <i>and</i> <span class="sc">Jack</span>. <i>Each has
an arm about the other's waist. Their eyes are glued on
each other's, and they proceed very, very slowly.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> My dear, you could hardly expect them both
to belong to the same class. That is never the way.
One is always rich, the other poor. One is always
good, the other bad. Ask one of them and see! But
if what I tell you is not convincing, consider the words
of Shakespeare, England's great minor poet, who in a
fit of melancholy once exclaimed&#8212;"Some are born
with parents, others acquire them. But most of us
just have the genus thrust upon us." (<span class="sc">Gloria</span> <i>is
unsuccessfully endeavoring to extricate herself from her
embarrassing position</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> Jack, you really should not speak that
way of England's poet. Your own father told me
this morning that no man could hope to understand
Shakespeare until he was forty. And that then he
wouldn't understand him.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> I don't doubt it. But you forget, Kathryn,
that I never had a father, and that hereafter my
responsibilities are numbered. (<i>They wheel slowly upon
them.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> Oh&#8212;father!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> What an extraordinary posture, Dill! Are
you aware of your menial, Miss Gibbs? (<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Kathryn</span>.)
He must think it's a circus. He's trying to stand on
his head.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn</span> (<i>looking away</i>). Perhaps he's praying.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Arise, sir, in the presence of your superiors!
(<span class="sc">Dill</span> <i>gets up very guiltily</i>.) And why these bags and
bundles, pray? Is your man about to start a millinery
establishment, Miss Gibbs?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span> (<i>almost in tears</i>). Mr. Hargrave! This
gentleman is not my servant. This gentleman is soon
to be my husband!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> It's the same thing.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn</span> (<i>shocked</i>). Oh! What would mother say!
I don't think I can ever allow you to become a butler
after all, Jack.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>glibly</i>). Dill, are you a polygamist, or what?
Define yourself! (<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Kathryn</span>.) I have yet to hear
of a menial Mormon.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> I am sure that mother will discharge
him now.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> Kathryn, I am your mother! If you
referred to my sister, I can only say that she is your
mother by adoption, that I suffered your adoption
solely because my time was taken up with my husband
and&#8212; (<i>tearfully</i>) Oh, you have no maternal instinct
whatever! I am sorry I ever brought you into the
world, you have saddened my life so completely.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill</span> (<i>comforting</i>. <span class="sc">Gloria</span> <i>who is in hysteria</i>). There,
there, my own&#8212;
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> That you whom I have loved as my own
child should object to your father, should be ashamed
of him who has waited upon your every want&#8212;oh,
it is terrible.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> Mother, you don't understand. I have
always liked Dill, and don't object to him at all. In
fact, I think it would be rather nice to keep him always
with us, and always, always ... (<span class="sc">Dill</span> <i>turns
pale</i>) as a butler. (<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Jack</span>.) Men are wont to
become oppressive when granted authority, and I feel
sure that Dill could never succeed as well at anything
else.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> You are always right, my dear, but see to
it at once. Contracts have ceased to be binding, and
what you want is a verbal understanding with your
mother.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span> (<i>embracing them</i>). My children, I forgive
you! As for Dill&#8212;that is settled.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="sc">Kathryn</span>). My money! (<i>Hands her bag.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> Beautiful, ideal money! (<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Jack</span>.) I
think he shows signs of submission already.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="sc">Jack</span>). My will! (<i>Hands him the will.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> I warned you about that, Dill. I said a
will was a very unsafe thing to have.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> My broken heart and soul! (<i>Hands that to</i>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span>.) Oh, take everything! (<i>Falls back into a
chair and buries his head in his hands.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="sc">Kathryn</span>). A man is at least your friend
who gives you money. No other friends get along
these days, or amount to anything.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> My dears, I agree with both of you. Your
father has enough money as it is, and any more would
surely spoil him. (<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Jack</span>.) I don't think husbands
should be allowed titles. Mine I know would squander
his. Moreover, in England the women have already
gotten their rights or are about to get them, which is
almost as bad. And when we women get the vote,
if there are titles left, they shall certainly belong to us.
You may keep the will, Jack, I assure you it is utterly
worthless, and probably recorded all over the country.
(<i>He and</i> <span class="sc">Kathryn</span> <i>stroll off</i>. <span class="sc">Gloria</span> <i>turns upon</i> <span class="sc">Dill</span>.)
I don't mind about your heart, for if it's broken you
couldn't use it, and I don't mind about the soul part
either, for I don't think you have one. But I do
seriously object to your wasting your money. (<i>Turns
her back to him.</i>) You'll never amount to anything.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> I have been always most saving, my dear.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> Less saving than spent, Dill.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn</span> (<i>tossing her latest gift into the air</i>). Lovely,
spiritual money. We can be married now, and you
won't have to work as a stoker in the ship after all.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Positively, my dear, I never dreamed of
such a thing!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn</span> (<i>pouting</i>). Of course, I never could have
allowed you to. You might have upset us all, and I'm
not going to be drowned for love or any other nonsense.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> But, my dear, if I upset the ship, it would
be your duty to get drowned. Any old captain will
tell you that. They know absolutely nothing. It's
like any other walk of life. A man wears whiskers, or
white hair, or something, and you fancy he's learned.
But he's not, and never will be. Sea-captains dress
as they do, and wear peculiar caps, not that they
should look like sea-captains, but that young innocent
persons like yourself should be deceived into thinking
them philosophers, or good men, or bad men, or some
kind of men at least. That explains the old and
venerable expression of thinking through your cap.
But it's all wrong. They never think at all.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> I've often gone fishing, Jack, and I've
never yet caught a fish. Do you think there are any
fishes in the sea, or is it just a myth like mermaids and
the millennium?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> That is purely a piscatorial problem. My
father is doubtless a proper authority. I know he
drinks like a fish, and he eats like a race horse. (<span class="sc">Dill</span>
<i>has been left entirely to his own reflections</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> What are you two over there saying about
running away?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>advancing solemnly</i>). Miss Gibbs, I have
something to tell you. (<i>Sits down and with knees
crossed nonchalantly lights cigarette.</i>) I have no money,
of course. Nobody has these days. The philanthropists
have stolen it all.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn</span> (<i>handing him money bag</i>). Of course not,
Jack, how absurd! But this will surely pay off some
of your debts.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Very few, my dear. You don't know what
debts are. Debts are a man's constant reminder that
even when he's very, very rich, one-half the money
in his pocket, and all the money in his bank, belongs
positively to somebody else.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> I seriously object to your morals, Jack.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Surely you would not blame me for that
which I never had?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> As the lady's father, I must at least inquire
of your habits, sir.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> I have no habits; even the good ones are
bad enough, and the bad ones are so hard to follow
out.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> I quite approve so far, Jack.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> I never vote.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> I have yet to know the man who did.
That's why they don't want us to.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> And I am proud to say that I have never
done even a single stroke of work.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> Oh! But you really must take up some
useful occupation, Jack, and go downtown very early
in the morning and come back very late every night.
Married life would be impracticable otherwise. One
could stand a husband in the morning and evening,
but a whole day added to each night would be out
of the question.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> You don't understand. Business today is
done under very bad principles. The proper way, in
truth, the only way that a young man of my temperament
could be induced to begin work, would be to
start right up at the top and go right down to the
bottom. It takes so much less time and trouble than
the old way of beginning at the bottom and stealing
one's way up to the top. Besides, one is just that much
more likely to land somewhere.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> I wish that I were a man. Here you
stand wasting my time talking, when in a few weeks
you might learn to be a messenger boy, and grow right
up into a millionaire.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> I'm not old enough for a messenger boy,
Kathryn. Messenger boys are never successful until
they become at least fifty and have long white
hair. Mine is a very firm yellow. I inherited it from
my mother.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> I thought you and Kathryn were having
an innocent flirtation only. (<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Dill</span>.) Men are
so deceiving.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> There's no such thing as an innocent flirtation,
Gloria. Naturally I shall have a great deal of
trouble convincing you of my love for your daughter.
I had expected that. When a man arrives at my age
of indiscretion, love is no longer to be thought of.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> Mr. Kent and I are no longer young, sir,
though we have been long in love.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn</span> (<i>to herself</i>). Kathryn Kent! What a
pretty name. (<i>Strolls off.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span> (<i>sharply</i>). I'm afraid you're thinking, Dill.
I am often aware of a most unpleasant sensation
whenever you indulge in that.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> I am, my love, I usually am.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> There's no use going further, Jack. It
can't be done.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>going to her</i>). What can't be done, my dear?
I think that rather a revolutionary sentiment, your
saying a thing can't be done, especially before trying
it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> The name, Jack, the name! There's no
use in losing that.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> What name, dear?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> Why, Kent, of course! I never could
marry a man named Hargrave.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>taking her hand tenderly</i>). Poor Kathryn!
So busy exchanging relations, she's completely forgotten
my name. I told you my name was really
Kent. It's as really Kent as yours is.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn</span> (<i>still dazed</i>). Ah, so you did! (<i>Goes over
to sofa.</i> <span class="sc">Dill</span> <i>follows&#8212;she plays with him with a piece
of string</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> And I told you that I had a number too.
(<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Gloria</span>.) Did I ever tell you, Gloria, that I had
a number? Such a lovely number! Hereafter I must
be known as John, plain John, Disciple No. 1, in
Crapsey's School for Socialism.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> Crapsey's School for Socialism?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> In Canterbury, England! And I hold the
unique distinction of being the only pupil that Crapsey
ever had.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> Jack, this is terrible!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>romping about</i>). So you refuse to give your
consent! Oh, I am so glad. It has always been my
ambition to marry someone whose parents absolutely
disapproved of me, who thought me utterly unfitted
for family life. (<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Kathryn</span>.) We shall have all
the fun of an elopement now, and when you have
finally divorced me, you can always recollect that your
parents advised you not to, and that they&#8212;(<i>pointing
to</i> <span class="sc">Gloria</span>) after all was said and done, knew absolutely
nothing of what they were talking about. (<span class="sc">Kathryn</span>
<i>does not look up</i>. <span class="sc">Dill</span>, <i>like a lazy lion, is lolling about
at her feet. Sometimes he paws for the string.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> I have this much to say, Mr. Hargrave,
and that is, that with or without my consent, you
shall never marry any daughter of mine.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>with provoking mirth</i>). Kent, if you please!
But why not? I am a socialist, of course, and I know
that the world is not yet prepared for socialism. But
we are only children as yet, and this is still the twentieth
century. When we reach the twenty-first and
become of age it will be time to talk about that.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> You are Kathryn's first cousin.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> I would be if I weren't adopted, Gloria.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> Your mother! (<i>Enter</i> <span class="sc">Jane</span>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Gloria was asking of my mother, Jane. It
is one of those impossible questions to answer, and
possibly why she asked.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Have you ever thought of your mother, Jack?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Oh, I remember my mother. I was adopted
almost before I was born and yet&#8212;
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> What was she like, dear?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Like no one else in the world, Jane. It's
hard to be sure of course, but I think she must have
been just the one woman who never could grow fat.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> At least I am not fat, Jack.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Oh, Jane&#8212;my mother!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> My son John! (<i>Enter</i> <span class="sc">Hargrave</span>. <i>His hair
is short and his costume more civilized. At sight of him</i>
<span class="sc">Dill</span> <i>grows instantly shy and timid. He retreats to
the shelter of</i> <span class="sc">Kathryn</span> <i>who, however, refuses to be taken
for a tree, and by a series of short playful jumps takes
him to the centre of the stage</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Father! Where is your hair? Have you
swallowed it?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Your father's hair and I have had a falling
out, Jack. We are decided to cut it upon first sight
hereafter.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> Water!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> Come out of there, Dill. Where are your
manners I should like to know? (<span class="sc">Dill</span> <i>holds tray and
hands a pitcher to</i> <span class="sc">Hargrave</span>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> Ah! (<i>Drains a glass.</i>) Ah! (<span class="sc">Dill</span>
<i>grows impatient and</i> <span class="sc">Hargrave</span> <i>grabs the pitcher</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> How degrading drink is! It's dangerous too.
There are more germs in water than in anything else
except whiskey, as scientists will tell you.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> I will break the news to you first, Jack.
Jane is really your mother, and&#8212;I think that he is
your father too.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="sc">Kathryn</span>). It is apparent that we never
can be married now, dear.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> You feel quite sure that we are safe?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> My dear, cousins could hardly afford to
marry, and though I don't believe a word that Gloria
said&#8212; (<i>Stops abruptly and goes over to</i> <span class="sc">Hargrave</span>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn</span> (<i>with a deep sigh of satisfaction</i>). Well,
that's over. (<i>Retreats to lounge.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>insolently</i>). Sir! I have already found my
mother. (<span class="sc">Gloria</span> <i>looks ominously at</i> <span class="sc">Jane</span>.) And ever
since I can remember I have been told I resembled
you.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="sc">Kathryn</span>). You said that you recognized
him at once, dear. (<span class="sc">Kathryn</span> <i>makes a little
face</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>earnestly</i>). Are you my father?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> I am not.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Who is my father?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> I don't know.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Your answers are satisfactory. In the
future I don't wish so distasteful a subject to be
broached again. (<i>Turns away impatiently.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> Did you say you had found your
mother?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> I did. (<i>Looks at</i> <span class="sc">Jane</span> <i>who shakes her head</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>eyeing them all a little suspiciously</i>).
May I then ask who your mother is, sir?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Ah, my mother is an angel. (<i>Looks up in
the air.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> Do not stand there blinking at the
stars. I am sorry your mother is dead, but I have
known that for years.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> Perhaps the will would put him in a better
humor, sir.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>handing it to him</i>). I forgot to tell you,
father, but I found it after all. (<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Kathryn</span>.) It's
easy enough to find a thing if you're not looking for it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>to them all</i>). I have just this much to
say&#8212;that even if I was disinherited by my father I
intend to take this matter to the courts. Fighting,
especially fighting for the right, has always been a
point of honor with me.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> One pig, Dill?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> One pig, then.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span> (<i>advancing</i>). As we do not seem able to
be married on land, Mr. Hargrave, Mr. Kent and I
have decided to try the water. We are sailing this
evening.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> You are not sailing in those trunks, Gloria?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> Mr. Hargrave, I am a lady. Those are
not trunks, those are my new hats.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> My idea, sir. It's to pass the custom house.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Would you like a sail across the pond, dear?
I know some capital fish stories, and can show you
where they catch the most gigantic fish. Father
caught a whale there or something of the sort.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> A shark, Jack, a shark, I'm sure.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Well whatever it was we're quite safe. Whenever
they strike a leak or the ship gets too heavy they
push all the women off into the little boats.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> What boat are you sailing on, may I
ask?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> The Baltic, Mr. Hargrave.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="sc">Jane</span>). I feel a little lonely, my
dear. Don't you think we might try a sail ourselves?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Yes, the rent's up.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> What idiots we all are.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> <span class="sc">Dill!</span> Come here! Did you not tell my
daughter in that letter that you were an idiot?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> I did, my dearest, indeed.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> Oh, the letter! And now I've lost it&#8212;what
a shame. I always read letters backward and
never did read more than the last paragraph anyway.
But it's the only letter from my father that I ever
had and I feel the loss of it already.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> Never fear, Miss Kathryn. I will write you
another. (<i>He thinks long and earnestly, but fails to
write.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> I have a present for you, Jack. (<i>Gives him
a bag similar to</i> <span class="sc">Gloria's</span>.) It was left me by
my father, but with disclosures of a nature which I
could not countenance. (<i>At R.</i>) I could never own
up to forty, Peter; never, never, never, if I were a
hundred.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> You must never own up to thirty, Jane; I
shall feel so very old when you do so. (<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Kathryn</span>.)
Don't you think we might get married after all, dear?
It is terrible to have so much money and not know
what to do with it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> Yes, love is very beautiful, isn't it?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>pulling other bag from trunk</i>). I knew I should
succeed some day, Jane; and I cannot thank either
you or your sister one-half enough.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane and Gloria</span> (<i>with one voice</i>). I was always
my father's favorite daughter! (<i>Each snatches a bag,
the two of which are carried off by</i> <span class="sc">Jack</span>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> Whatever are you doing, Dill? Are you
writing a letter to the Pope? (<i>Bell rings.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> I distinctly heard a noise. (<i>Bell rings more
loudly.</i>) I am seldom mistaken, Dill, and as you are
still the butler (<i>Bell peals again</i>).
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> Hurry, Dill. It may be some distinguished
guest. (<i>Exit</i> <span class="sc">Dill</span> <i>very slowly</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> I have never heard a bell ring that way
before. I was sure ours had been broken for months.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Belles always are, I believe.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> I have taken a dislike to this one
already.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> It sounds painfully reminiscent. You do
not ring that way, Father?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave.</span> Someday I shall wring your neck,
sir.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> You must learn to control your temper,
Peter. I don't mind your trying it out on your relatives,
but until it gets quite, quite perfect you must
remember never to practise it on me. (<i>Takes away his
glasses and places them on table.</i>) It was only his
glasses, Jack.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> This suspense is killing me. I know I
look like a tableau.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> My dear, your dress is too low! You must
not show your neck until late in the evening, or at
least until the lights are turned on and everyone is
looking.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> I am glad we have chosen so large a boat.
I feel as though I weighed a ton already.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> I will not wait one moment longer.
No! not for the Empress of Egypt, if there is such a
thing. (<i>Goes forward.</i>) Dill can bring the bundles.
(<i>They follow her to the door, only to recoil in astonishment
as</i> <span class="sc">Col. Christopher Crapsey</span> <i>appears. He is
prodding</i> <span class="sc">Dill</span> <i>with his sword which he sheathes gallantly
upon beholding</i> <span class="sc">Kathryn</span>. <i>The others he salutes
sternly. In fact he salutes at every opportunity, his
chief occupation being apparently this same salute,
preceded each time by three mighty strides and heels together in approved military fashion. He has all the
vulgar airs of a soldier, of even a retired soldier.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Crapsey</span> (<i>after saluting everybody and everything in
sight</i>). Col. Christopher Crapsey&#8212;retired Army officer&#8212;Socialist&#8212;and&#8212;(<i>delves into pocket for card</i>).
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> The tray, Dill&#8212;the tray! (<i>The effect
produced by the mention of the word</i> <span class="sc">Crapsey</span> <i>stuns
everyone, with the exception of</i> <span class="sc">Kathryn</span> <i>and</i> <span class="sc">Dill</span>,
<i>who have no knowledge of what a really interesting person
the Colonel is</i>. <span class="sc">Jane</span>, <i>of course, was expecting him. But</i>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> <i>was not, and, after adjusting his glasses and
taking one furtive glance, he disappears up the chimney</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill</span> (<i>bowing deeply</i>). I must observe for the
second time, sir, that your bearing is most soldierly.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Crapsey</span> (<i>drawing sword</i>). Silence, sir. (<i>Empties
seven or eight cards on tray and again repeats the ominous
words.</i>) Col. Christopher Crapsey, retired Army
officer!&#8212;Socialist&#8212;and&#8212;
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="sc">Jack</span>). I am so surprised&#8212;I thought
the men of war were all at sea, and fighting with their
wives, or with themselves.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>audibly</i>). I think the man's a fool.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> I'm sure of it.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span> (<i>admonishingly</i>). Little do either of you
know how much the Colonel's visit portends. (<span class="sc">Crapsey</span>
<i>glares at all of them</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> This is my last broken ideal. And I so young!
What a pity.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Crapsey</span> (<i>looking about him</i>). Ah, I forgot. Jane
Gibbs, I believe. (<i>Goes up to Gloria.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> I am Jane Gibbs. You wanted to see me
about my son, did you not?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Crapsey.</span> I did.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> Pray proceed. We are all prepared for
the worst.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Crapsey.</span> Ah, it is for the very best.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> How very too bad! Nothing thrills me
like a disappointment, and now even you refuse to
marry someone else, Jack.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Crapsey</span> (<i>annoyed at the interruption</i>). For the
very best! I have decided your son shall remain with
me. (<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Gloria</span>.) It is hard to realize the effect
that environment has on the young. It is much more
vital than heredity, and John I feel bound to state is
the exact image of me. He has my eyes, my commanding
manner, my masterly stride.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">John</span> (<i>from the other end of the room</i>). Have you
come here to insult me, sir?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> But I thought John was a scholar, Colonel?
You have written several letters about his French,
and you said his Shakespeare was perfect.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Crapsey.</span> He is more than a scholar, madam.
Your son is a soldier. He has the soldier's finer feelings,
and some day will surely join the ranks to become as
famous as his guardian was before him.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> I'd rather die than fight for anyone.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Crapsey</span> (<i>trying not to hear</i>). Yes, for twenty
years he has been mine. He has been a dutiful, affectionate
son and a help to me in that institution which
is destined some day to become known throughout
the entire world. But come! (<i>Consults his watch.</i>)
There's little time. I arrived yesterday on the Burgoyne
and I sail tonight on the Baltic.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> The Baltic?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Crapsey</span> (<i>violently</i>). The Baltic! But it does not
concern you in the least.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="sc">Kathryn</span>). I assure you, my dear, that
all this has reference to me.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Crapsey</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="sc">Jane</span>). Your decision, pray?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> I will not go.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Crapsey.</span> Madam?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> I will not go.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Crapsey.</span> Madam, your decision!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> It is easily decided, Jane. I refuse to go.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Crapsey</span> (<i>marching up to him</i>). I did not ask you
to go, sir! Your conduct is an impertinence.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="sc">Jane</span>). I will not live with a lunatic.
Surely the law must side with me there.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Crapsey</span> (<i>roaring with rage</i>). Who is this offensive
young person, may I ask, who insults me in this fashion?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>stepping out</i>). I am John, plain John, Disciple
No. 1, in Crapsey's School for Socialism. And
I hold the dubious distinction of being the only pupil
you ever had. (<span class="sc">Crapsey's</span> <i>feelings are hurt beyond
expression. He wilts perceptibly. At length, with whatever
dignity is still his, he turns his back upon the company
and stalks for the door. There he hesitates for a
moment and all draw back in doubt as to whether he is
about to go or charge upon them.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>crawling out</i>). Is he gone? (<i>He presents
a droll figure, sooted and covered with dust.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Crapsey</span> (<i>returning with two or three wondrous strides</i>).
I am not gone, sir. And who are you?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> This is my adopted father, the Rev. Peter
Kent, alias Hargrave. (<span class="sc">Crapsey</span> <i>stares icily, then
adjusts an extraordinary pair of glasses to his nose</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Crapsey.</span> Aha! (<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> <i>shivers</i>.) So I have
not tracked you twenty years in vain. (<i>Draws sword.</i>)
You changed your name, but I am too clever to be
mislead by a woman's guile. Defend yourself, sir!
I remember&#8212;the truth is stronger than the sword!
Come on, sir. (<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> <i>retreats to fireplace</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Fighting always was his forte, Crapsey,
especially fighting for the right. If my life was as
worthless as yours, father, I'd be fighting all the time.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Crapsey</span> (<i>turning fiercely on</i> <span class="sc">Jack</span>). Shall I run
you through and through, sir? (<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> <i>glides
behind the table</i>.) This creature stole you from me
years ago. But he is welcome to you&#8212;to all of you.
I think it is a den of thieves.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Curb your emotions, Colonel. This man
is soon to be my husband, and Jack was first of all my
son. (<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> <i>is fired to action by this apparent
disclosure. Forgetting his fears he stamps jealously up
to</i> <span class="sc">Crapsey</span> <i>who meets him half way. They stand face
to face.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave and Crapsey</span> (<i>together</i>). Her son!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="sc">Kathryn</span>). I told you, my dear, that
it was really so.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> Yes, my own adopted son. I found him in
one of the fashionable parks of England's great
city ... quite homeless, quite dirty, and without
name or parents. I called him John.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Thank you, Jane. I knew Gloria could
never speak the truth.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> You have been a most extravagant young
man, Jack. Every dollar which I have spent on your
education has been squandered.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Crapsey.</span> And every dollar has been used in
running this man down. You must admit that I have
been successful. (<i>Smiles at the thought of his accomplishments
and seats himself comfortably.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>well behind the table</i>). I have no doubt
that you will still land in jail, sir.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Crapsey</span> (<i>bounding to his feet</i>). Aha! For you, sir,
I have something in the nature of a surprise. (<i>Fumbles
in pockets.</i>) After many failures I have at last obtained
a hearing before the Archbishop; and he, like the
honest, upright man that he is, has decreed that you
be unfrocked. I have the order with me.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> I said you'd be unfrocked, father.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>discarding vest</i>). I am glad of it. For
twenty years these clothes weighed upon my soul,
ruined my digestion, dyed my hair, and made me the
man I am.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> Your reformation is complete, Jane.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill.</span> In that case, sir, insomuch as my father
specifically stated in the will that he had disinherited
you solely because you had entered the ministry, I
turn over one-half the estate to you. (<span class="sc">Gloria</span> <i>stares
at him reproachfully</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>kneeling</i>). My brother! forgive me!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Crapsey.</span> The will! What will!
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Hargrave</span> (<i>holding Dill's hand and the will in the
air</i>). The will of the late John Kent of Canterbury,
whose elder son I am.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Crapsey.</span> Pooh! (<i>Tears it to pieces.</i>) Absolutely
worthless, revoked it before he died.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Chorus of Voices.</span> Revoked it?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Crapsey.</span>. Revoked it! And seeing at the last the
error of his ways, by the merciful will of God left
every cent he possessed to a School for Socialism, to
be founded in ye good and ancient city of Canterbury,
whose ruling spirit I am. The new will was discovered
just previous to my departure for this country.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Discord of Voices.</span> Oh! (<i>Each seeks a chair</i>, <span class="sc">Dill</span>
<i>alone being left in the scuffle</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Dill</span> (<i>holding up bag</i>). At any rate we do not
need for money, sir. (<span class="sc">Crapsey</span> <i>tosses the coins contemptuously
into the air</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Crapsey.</span> Bah! American pennies, as worthless
as the American dollar. (<i>All are visibly annoyed.</i>)
But hurry! My time is nearly up. Do I go alone, or
will some of the party accompany me?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> We'll be the young married couple, Jack.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> We'll be the sisters, Gloria.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Gloria.</span> Yes, and Dill will be the butler. (<i>All but</i>
<span class="sc">Dill</span> <i>and</i> <span class="sc">Jane</span> <i>assent</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jane.</span> I think, Peter, that as your brother has
been the butler for twenty years it is only fair that
you should now take his place.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> No one can ever take my father's place.
It may sound like affectation, but it's not. Dill will
be the butler.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Crapsey.</span> That is impossible! In my school the
women work and do all the work. (<i>All the men and</i>
<span class="sc">Dill</span> <i>are jubilant</i>.) One thing still requires our attention.
After what person, or persons, shall the institution
be called?
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack, Hargrave and Dill</span> (<i>displaying their now
reluctant better halves</i>). After my&#8212;
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Crapsey.</span> One name at a time, please.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Voices Three.</span> The Convolvulus.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Crapsey.</span> Then that is settled. Company fall in.
(<span class="sc">Crapsey</span> <i>stands superbly at the head; next</i> <span class="sc">Jane</span> <i>and</i>
<span class="sc">Gloria</span>; <i>next</i> <span class="sc">Hargrave</span> <i>and</i> <span class="sc">Dill</span>. <span class="sc">Kathryn</span> <i>tries to
hold</i> <span class="sc">Jack</span> <i>in last place with her, but he breaks away and
goes up to</i> <span class="sc">Hargrave</span>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack.</span> I told you, father, that I was going to complete
my education; and perhaps some day I shall
have the distinction of a number. (<span class="sc">Crapsey</span> <i>hits him
a vicious crack with his sword just as</i> <span class="sc">Jack</span> <i>takes</i> <span class="sc">Jane's</span>
<i>chattels away from her. These he adds to</i> <span class="sc">Gloria's</span>
<i>already prodigious pile and joins the ranks</i>.)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Kathryn.</span> I feel just as if I were boarding the Ark.
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Crapsey.</span> The Baltic! Forward march! (<i>They
describe a short circle</i>, <span class="sc">Jack</span> <i>whistling the "Marseillaise,"
"Onward Christian Soldiers," or some terrible tango tune.
Any old tune will not do, however, and care should be
taken in its selection and use.</i>)
</p>

<p>
<span class="sc">Jack</span> (<i>disappearing</i>). Dear me! It's five-fifteen,
and they're beating their wives in London now. (<i>Exeunt
all.</i>)
